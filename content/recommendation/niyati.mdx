description: I know Ayush since January 2024 as a mentee for undergraduate final year team project. An excellent SPOC, he has an affinity to troubles (for solving them of course)-both technical and managerial. He under promises and overdelivers and thus never misses a deadline. I earnestly recommend him for his current and future roles as he's an extremely valuable intellectual asset.

I know Ayush since January 2024 as a mentee for undergraduate final year team project. An excellent SPOC, he has an affinity to troubles (for solving them of course)-both technical and managerial. He under promises and overdelivers and thus never misses a deadline. 

I earnestly recommend him for his current and future roles as he's an extremely valuable intellectual asset. 

**The project resulted in a publication at 21st IWSLT (co-located with Tier 1 62nd ACL):**
